		This scripting API is very powerful and as such there are some important reminders to take note of:\n\n- Your script has a max execution time of 1000 milliseconds, however it is still possible to create scripts that significantly slow down the game. It is your responsibility to ensure your script runs efficiently.\n\n- Random number functions are provided by the Lua math library. Use of randomness in your scripts is likely to cause desync in multiplayer, so use these functions at your own risk.\n\n- When your vehicle despawns and respawns, your script will be executed 'fresh' and any state stored within the script will be lost. We recommend keeping your script as stateless as possible, and making use of existing logic components (e.g. memory register) to store values that you wish to persist.\n\n- Your scripts run as a 'black box' with only the logic inputs/outputs being synced in multiplayer. Keep in mind that complex logic in your script may behave differently for different players in a multiplayer session.\n\n- A number of safeguards are in place to sandbox your script, however it is still possible to write scripts that will potentially crash your game. If you crash your game with a script, it's likely that you're doing something (very) wrong. This is your own responsibility. If you suspect you have encountered a legitimate bug, please report it on the Stormworks issue tracker (accessible from the pause-menu).\n\n- Malicious and harmful scripts will not be tolerated on the Stormworks Steam Workshop.\n\nFinally, enjoy the almost limitless possibilities that these scripts provide. This short wiki aims to give a good overview of how scripting in Stormworks works, however if you have any questions that are not covered here, please feel free to join us on Discord (accessible from the pause-menu)!
