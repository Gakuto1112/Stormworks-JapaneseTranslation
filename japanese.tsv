		LUA SCRIPTING OVERVIEW	LUAスクリプトの概要
		Lua scripting gives you the tools to create advanced logic components using the Lua scripting language. Stormworks provides a number of functions to allow your script to interface with your vehicle's logic system, as well as drawing to in-game monitors.\n\nThis guide outlines the functions that are available for use in your scripts but it is not a comprehensive tutorial on using the Lua language.	LuaスクリプトではLua言語を用いて高度な論理システムを作成できます. Stormworksでは乗り物の論理システムと連動させたり, ゲーム内のモニターに描画したりするための関数を多数用意しています.\n\nこのガイドではStormworksで使用できる関数の概要を説明しますが, Lua言語自体のチュートリアルは説明しません.
		SCRIPT BASICS	スクリプトの基本
		The tick function will be called once every logic tick and should be used for reading composite data and any required processing. Screen functions will have no effect if called within onTick.	onTick関数は1論理チック当たりに1回呼び出され, 複合信号の読み書きや, 必要な処理に使用します. この関数内でscreen関数は呼び出せません.
		The draw function will be called any time this script is drawn by a monitor. Note that it can be called multiple times if this microcontroller is connected to multiple monitors whereas onTick is only called once. Composite input/output functions will have no effect if called within onDraw.	　onDraw関数はモニターに何かを描画する度に呼び出されます. onTick関数が1論理チック当たりに1回しか呼び出されないのに対して, onDraw関数は接続されているモニターの数だけ呼び出されます. この関数で複合信号を読み書きする関数は呼び出せません.
		COMPOSITE INPUT/OUTPUT	複合信号の読み書き
		PROPERTIES	プロパティの読み取り
		Read the values of property components within this microcontroller directly. The label passed to each function should match the label that has been set for the property you're trying to access (case-sensitive).	マイクロコントローラーのプロパティを直接読み取れます(複合信号などを通して接続する必要はありません.). プロパティの読み取りの関数に渡すプロパティ名は, 読み取りたいプロパティ名と完全に一致させて下さい (大文字と小文字を区別します.).
		Read values from the composite input. Index ranges from 1 - 32.	入力された複合信号の数値を読み取ります. インデックの範囲は1から32です.
		Set values on the composite output. Index ranges from 1 - 32.	出力する複合信号に数値を設定します. インデックの範囲は1から32です.
		DRAWING	モニターへの描画
		Set the current draw colour. Values range from 0 - 255.	描画する色を設定します. 次にこの関数が呼ばれるまでこの色は継続されます. それぞれの値の範囲は 0 から 255 です.
		Set the current draw colour and transparency. Values range from 0 - 255.	描画する色と透明度を設定します. 次にこの関数が呼ばれるまでこの色と透明度は継続されます. それぞれの値の範囲は 0 から 255 です.
		Clear the screen with the current colour.	現在の色でモニター全体を塗りつぶします.
		Draw line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2).	(x1, y1) から (x2, y2) に線を描画します.
		Draw circle at (x, y) with radius.	(x, y) を中心に指定された半径の円を描画します.
		Draw filled circle at (x, y) with radius.	(x, y) を中心に指定された半径の円を塗りつぶして描画します.
		Draw rectangle at (x, y) with width and height.	(x, y) を始点に指定された幅と高さの矩形を描画します.
		Draw filled rectangle at (x, y) with width and height.	(x, y) を始点に指定された幅と高さの矩形塗りつぶしてを描画します.
		Draw triangle between (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3).	(x1, y1) と (x2, y2) と (x3, y3) を頂点とする三角形を描画します.
		Draw filled triangle between (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3).	(x1, y1) と (x2, y2) と (x3, y3) を頂点とする三角形を塗りつぶして描画します.
		Draw text at (x, y). Each character is 4 pixels wide and 5 pixels tall.	(x, y) を始点にテキストを描画します. 1文字につき幅 4 ピクセル, 高さ 5 ピクセルです.
		Draw text within the rectangle at (x, y) with width and height. Text alignment can be specified using the last two parameters and ranges from -1 to 1 (left to right, top to bottom). If either of the alignment parameters are omitted, the text will be drawn top-left by default. Text will automatically wrap at spaces when possible, and will overflow the top/bottom of the specified rectangle if too large.	(x, y) を始点に指定された幅と高さの矩形の中にテキストを描画します. 最後の2つの引数でテキストの基準位置をしていします. 範囲は -1 から 1 です (左から右, 上からした).  この引数が省略された場合, デフォルトで左上が基準となります. テキストは矩形の範囲内に収まるように自動的に折り返され, それでも入りきらない場合は, テキストの上下がはみ出ます.
		Draw the world map centred on map coordinate (x,y) with zoom level ranging from 0.1 to 50.	(x, y) 座標を中心として指定された縮尺でワールドマップを描画します. 縮尺の範囲は 0.1 から 50 です.
		Set the colours used for rendering the map. Values range from 0 - 255, alpha is optional.	マップ描画に使用される色を設定します. それぞれの値の範囲は 0 から 255 です. アルファ値は任意の引数です.
		Get the width/height of the screen currently being rendered to.	描画しているモニターの幅/高さを取得します.
		MAP	座標変換
		Convert pixel coordinates into world coordinates.	モニター上の座標をマップ上の座標に変換します.
		Convert world coordinates into pixel coordinates.	マップ上の座標をモニター上の座標に変換します.
		LUA FUNCTIONS	Lua関数
		The following global lua functions are available:\n\n- pairs\n- ipairs\n- next\n- tostring\n- tonumber\n\nand additional functions are available through the following lua libraries:\n\n- math\n- table\n- string\n\nFor full documentation of the functions provided by these libraries, visit https://www.lua.org/manual/.	次のLua関数を使用できます:\n\n- pairs\n- ipairs\n- next\n- tostring\n- tonumber\n\nまた, 次のLuaライブラリ関数を使用できます:\n\n- math\n- table\n- string\n\nこれらの関数のリファレンスドキュメントはこちらのページを参照して下さい. https://www.lua.org/manual/ (英語マニュアル)
		TELEMETRY FUNCTIONS	http通信関数
		The following global async functions are available:\n\n- httpGet\n\nHTTP requests are sent to the localhost on the specified port. Responses are caught with the httpReply(port, request_body, response_body) callback function.\n\nasync.httpGet(port, request_body)\n\nExample of a HTTP request sent to port 80:	これらの非同期関数を使用できます:\n\n- httpGet\n\n指定されたポートからローカルホストに向けてhttpリクエストを送信します. レスポンスはコールバック関数 httpReply(ポート番号, リクエスト本文, レスポンス本文) を使用して捕捉できます.\n\nasync.httpGet(port, request_body)\n\n次は 80 番ポートからhttpリクエストを送信する例です:
		META FROM THE DEVS	Stormworks開発者からのコメント
		This scripting API is very powerful and as such there are some important reminders to take note of:\n\n- Your script has a max execution time of 1000 milliseconds, however it is still possible to create scripts that significantly slow down the game. It is your responsibility to ensure your script runs efficiently.\n\n- Random number functions are provided by the Lua math library. Use of randomness in your scripts is likely to cause desync in multiplayer, so use these functions at your own risk.\n\n- When your vehicle despawns and respawns, your script will be executed 'fresh' and any state stored within the script will be lost. We recommend keeping your script as stateless as possible, and making use of existing logic components (e.g. memory register) to store values that you wish to persist.\n\n- Your scripts run as a 'black box' with only the logic inputs/outputs being synced in multiplayer. Keep in mind that complex logic in your script may behave differently for different players in a multiplayer session.\n\n- A number of safeguards are in place to sandbox your script, however it is still possible to write scripts that will potentially crash your game. If you crash your game with a script, it's likely that you're doing something (very) wrong. This is your own responsibility. If you suspect you have encountered a legitimate bug, please report it on the Stormworks issue tracker (accessible from the pause-menu).\n\n- Malicious and harmful scripts will not be tolerated on the Stormworks Steam Workshop.\n\nFinally, enjoy the almost limitless possibilities that these scripts provide. This short wiki aims to give a good overview of how scripting in Stormworks works, however if you have any questions that are not covered here, please feel free to join us on Discord (accessible from the pause-menu)!	スクリプトAPIは非常に強力であるため, 重要な注意事項があります.\n\n- スクリプトの最大実行時間は 1000 ミリ秒ですが, ゲームを遅延させるスクリプトを組むことも可能です. 各自の責任でスクリプトの最適化を行って下さい.\n\n- 乱数関数はmathライブラリで提供されますが, マルチプレイでの同期が上手くいかない場合があります. そのため, 乱数関数の使用は自己責任となります. \n\n- 乗り物がアンロードされた後, 再ロードにスクリプトは初期化され, 新しく実行し直されるため, スクリプト内で保持している情報は失われます. 安全に情報を保持したい場合は, できる限り既存の論理部品 (メモリレジスタなど) で情報を保持するようにして下さい. \n\n- スクリプトは「ブラックボックス」として動作し, マルチプレイではロジックの入出力のみが同期されます. 複雑なスクリプトの場合, プレイヤー毎に異なる動作をする場合があります. \n\n- スクリプト実行にあたって, 危険なコードが実行されないようにいくつもの安全策が施されていますが, それでもなおゲームを強制終了させるコードを組むことが可能です. もしスクリプト実行時にゲームが強制終了してしまった場合は, 何か (大きな) 間違いを犯している可能性があります. これはあなた自身の責任です. 明らかにStormworks側の不具合が原因と思われる場合は, ポーズメニューから不具合の報告を行って下さい. \n\n- 悪意のあるスクリプトはSteamワークショップで禁止されています.\n\n最後に, スクリプトの無限の可能性をお楽しみ下さい. この短いマニュアルではStormworksでのスクリプトの動作いついての概要を説明することを目的としていますが, 何か不明な点がある場合は, お気軽に公式Discordサーバーにご参加ください (ポーズメニューあからアクセスできます).
		TOUCHSCREEN DATA	タッチスクリーン情報
		The composite output from the monitors contains data that can be interpreted in your script to create touchscreens. The layout of the composite data is as follows:\n\nNumber Channels\n1: monitorResolutionX\n2: monitorResolutionY\n3: input1X\n4: input1Y\n5: input2X\n6: input2Y\n\nOn/Off Channels:\n1: isInput1Pressed\n2: isInput2Pressed\n\nThis is an example of a script that outputs a signal on composite channel 1 if the player is pressing the screen within a specific rectangle:	モニターからの複合信号には, スクリプトで処理することでタッチパネルとして動作する情報が含まれています. 複合信号の構成は以下の通りです:\n\n数値チャンネル:\n1: モニターの横の解像度\n2: モニターの縦の解像度\n3: 主入力のx座標\n4: 主入力のy座標\n5: 副入力のx座標\n6: 副入力のy座標\n\nオン/オフチャンネル\n1: 主入力がタッチされているかどうか\n2: 副入力がタッチされているかどうか\n\n次はプレイヤーが特定の矩形内をタッチている場合複合信号のオン/オフ信号1チャンネルｍにオン信号を出力するスクリプトの例です:
